# Experimental scripts

This folder contains the scripts for experiment.

If you want to reproduce the results shown in the paper, simply download the pre-processed data and checkpoints and run [RECA-semtab-test-from-pre-trained.py](https://github.com/ysunbp/RECA-paper/blob/main/Semtab/experiment/RECA-semtab-test-from-pre-trained.py), which will show the experimental results for the pre-trained models.

If you want to train the models from scratch, you can download the pre-processed data or pre-process the data following the instructions in the [pre-process](https://github.com/ysunbp/RECA-paper/tree/main/Semtab/pre-process) folder and then run [RECA-semtab-train+test.py](https://github.com/ysunbp/RECA-paper/blob/main/Semtab/experiment/RECA-semtab-train%2Btest.py) to see the results.
