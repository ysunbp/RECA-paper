# Pre-trained models

Due to the capacity limit of GitHub, we upload the pre-trained checkpoints (2G) to Google drive. You can download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C5w7eUhJxe9NFKJdBJWlm6qO7SYZddJ8/view?usp=sharing), unzip, and place them in this folder.

We provide the checkpoints for all of the five folds for your reference.
